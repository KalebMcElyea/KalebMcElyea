### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kaleb McElyea and I am 25 years old.  I'm currently a student with Boise Codeworks! My current goal is to graduate and become a software developer. Fun fact about me is that ASL (American Sign Language) was the first language I learned before becoming effecient in English.
